    "#Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "#A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed on a computer system. It provides a way to organize and store large amounts of data, as well as to retrieve and manipulate that data as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to manage relational databases. It provides a way to create, modify, and query data in a structured manner using tables, columns, and rows. SQL databases are typically used for applications that require strict data consistency and reliability, such as financial systems and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#On the other hand, NoSQL databases (Not Only SQL) are databases that do not use the traditional tabular relations used by SQL databases. They are often used for applications that require flexible and scalable data storage and retrieval, such as social media platforms and big data applications. NoSQL databases can store and retrieve data in a variety of formats, including key-value, document-oriented, and graph databases."

    "#Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "#DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of a database. It includes commands for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#CREATE is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table named \"customers\":\n",
    "# CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "  #id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  #name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  #email VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "#);\n",
    "\n",
    "#DROP is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "# DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "#ALTER is used to modify the structure of existing database objects such as tables and views. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column named \"address\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ALTER TABLE customers ADD address VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "#RUNCATE is used to delete all rows from a table. Unlike the DROP statement, TRUNCATE retains the table structure. For example, the following SQL statement removes all rows from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "# TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n"

    "\n",
    "#INSERT is used to add new rows to a table. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new customer to the \"customers\" table:\n",
