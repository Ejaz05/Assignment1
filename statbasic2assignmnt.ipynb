    "The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency, especially when the data is normally distributed.

    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It is a robust measure of central tendency that is not affected by outliers or extreme values.

    "The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It is useful for describing the most common value or category in a dataset, especially for nominal or categorical data. The mode is also robust to outliers and extreme values, but it may not exist or be unique if no value is repeated in the dataset.\n",

    "Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe\n",
    "the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe how spread out or dispersed the data is in a dataset. These measures indicate the degree to which the individual data points in a dataset vary from the central tendency measure (such as mean or median) and each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea about the spread of the data in the most simple way possible. However, it doesn't give any information about the variation of the data between the two extremes. For example, if we have a dataset of the heights of a group of people, and the range is 20 cm, it means that the difference between the tallest and shortest person is 20 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance is a measure of how far each data point is from the mean. It gives a quantitative measure of the spread of the data, taking into account all the data points. A high variance indicates that the data points are spread far apart from the mean, while a low variance indicates that the data points are close to the mean. For example, if we have a dataset of exam scores, and the variance is 25, it means that the individual scores in the dataset are quite far from the average score of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a commonly used measure of dispersion and is also the most interpretable, since it is in the same unit as the original data. A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread far apart from the mean, while a low standard deviation indicates that the data points are close to the mean. For example, if we have a dataset of the weights of a group of people, and the standard deviation is 10 kg, it means that the individual weights in the dataset are quite far from the average weight of the group.\n",

    "Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",

    "Ans: Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the degree of asymmetry in a distribution of data. A distribution is said to be skewed if it is not symmetrical, meaning that it does not have an equal number of values on both sides of the central tendency. In a skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution is either longer or shorter on one side compared to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the direction and degree of the skew. Positive skewness means that the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side, indicating that the data is concentrated towards the lower values, with a few high values. Negative skewness means that the tail of the distribution is longer on the left side, indicating that the data is concentrated towards the higher values, with a few low values. Zero skewness indicates that the data is symmetrical around the central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is an important aspect of data analysis because it can affect the choice of statistical methods and the interpretation of results. For example, skewed data can lead to biased estimates of central tendency and variability, and can influence the choice of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. Therefore, it is important to examine the skewness of the data before drawing any conclusions or making any decisions based on the data.\n",

    "Ans: If a dataset is right-skewed, the mean is typically greater than the median. This is because the right tail of the distribution is longer and contains more extreme values, which pull the mean towards the right. At the same time, the median is resistant to extreme values and is therefore less affected by the longer right tail. As a result, the median tends to be closer to the center of the distribution and is typically smaller than the mean in a right-skewed distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together. It is a measure of the linear association between two variables, which indicates the direction and strength of the relationship. A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship between the variables, meaning that they tend to increase or decrease together. A negative covariance indicates a negative relationship between the variables, meaning that one variable tends to increase while the other decreases. However, the magnitude of the covariance does not give an idea of how strong the relationship is, because it depends on the units of measurement of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, but it is standardized to eliminate the effect of units of measurement.

This happens because the mean is calculated by summing up all the data points and dividing by the total number of data points. If an outlier is much larger or smaller than the other data points, it will have a disproportionate effect on the sum, leading to a shift in the mean. On the other hand, the median is not as affected by outliers, as it is simply the middle value in a sorted dataset.\n",

    "In terms of measures of dispersion, outliers can increase the range and variance of the dataset. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. If an outlier is much larger or smaller than the other data points, it can increase the range significantly. Variance measures the spread of the data points around the mean. Outliers that are much larger or smaller than the other data points can increase the variance significantly, making it more difficult to generalize about the population being studied.\n",

    "For example, consider a dataset of exam scores for a class of 20 students. Most of the students scored between 70 and 90, but one student scored a 30. This student's score is an outlier. If we calculate the mean score for the class, the presence of the outlier will lower the mean, making it appear that the class did worse overall than they actually did. If we calculate the range or variance of the scores, the outlier will increase these measures, making it appear that the scores were more spread out than they actually were.\n",
