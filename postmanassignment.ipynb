    "#Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "#Ans: GET and POST are two commonly used HTTP methods for requesting and sending data between a client and a server. Both methods are used to retrieve or submit data, but they have different characteristics and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The GET method is used to request data from a server. When a client makes a GET request, it sends a URL and any necessary parameters to the server, and the server responds with the requested data. The GET method is typically used for retrieving data, such as web pages, images, and other resources. It is a \"safe\" method, meaning that it should not have any side effects on the server, and should not modify any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The POST method is used to submit data to a server. When a client makes a POST request, it sends data in the request body to the server, and the server responds with a status code and any additional data. The POST method is typically used for submitting data, such as form submissions, file uploads, and other actions that modify data on the server. It is not a \"safe\" method, as it can have side effects on the server and modify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In summary, the GET method is used for requesting data from a server, while the POST method is used for submitting data to a server. The GET method is \"safe\" and should not modify data, while the POST method can modify data and is not considered \"safe\"."

    "#Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "#Ans: In Flask, the request object is used to access incoming data from a client's HTTP request. When a client makes a request to a Flask application, the request object provides access to the data sent by the client in the request. This can include data from HTML forms, query parameters in the URL, and other data sent in the request body.\n",
    "#The request object provides a convenient way to access this data in a Flask view function. Developers can use the request object to access form data, query parameters, and other data sent in the request. They can also use the request object to access information about the client's request, such as the HTTP method used, the headers sent with the request, and other metadata."
