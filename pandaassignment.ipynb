    "#drop(): This function allows you to remove rows or columns from the DataFrame. For example, df.drop(columns=[\"column_name\"]) removes the column with the name \"column_name\" from the DataFrame df.\n",

    "#groupby(): This function allows you to group the rows of the DataFrame based on one or more columns, and then apply a function to each group. For example, df.groupby(\"column_name\").mean() groups the rows of the DataFrame df based on the values in the column with the name \"column_name\", and then calculates the mean value for each group.\n",

    "#merge(): This function allows you to combine two or more DataFrames based on a common column. For example, if you have two DataFrames df1 and df2 with a common column \"column_name\", you can merge them using pd.merge(df1, df2, on=\"column_name\").\n",

For example, pd.pivot_table(df, values=\"value_column\", index=\"row_column\", columns=\"column_column\", aggfunc=\"mean\") creates a pivot table where the mean value of the \"value_column\" is calculated for each combination of values in the \"row_column\" and \"column_column\".\n",

If you want to calculate some statistics for each group of rows based on a certain column, you can use df.groupby()."
