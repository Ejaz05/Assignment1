    "#A1. Abstraction in OOPs refers to the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the users. This helps in reducing the complexity of the system and improving the security of the implementation. An example of abstraction in OOPs can be seen in a bank system, where a customer interacts with the bank using a debit card, but the internal workings of the system such as the database, servers, and the algorithms used for transactions, are hidden from the customer.\n",

    "#A2. Abstraction and Encapsulation are related concepts in OOPs but are different from each other. Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the users. On the other hand, Encapsulation refers to the wrapping of data and functions within a single unit or object. Encapsulation helps in hiding the implementation details and providing a secure way to access the data. An example of Encapsulation can be seen in a class where member variables are kept private and accessed through public methods.\n",
