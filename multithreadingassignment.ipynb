    "# Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ans: Multithreading in Python is the ability to run multiple threads within a single program, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks. Each thread runs independently, allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously within a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Multithreading is used to improve the performance of programs that can benefit from parallel processing. By running multiple threads, a program can utilize multiple CPUs or CPU cores, which can significantly improve its performance. Multithreading can be particularly useful in applications that are I/O-bound or involve long-running tasks, such as network servers, data processing, and scientific computing.\n",

    "\n",
    "#Ans:\n",
    "#In the context of the threading module in Python, the following are the functions and their explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#run(): This method is called when a thread starts running. It is the entry point for the thread's execution, and it is where the thread's code is defined. The run() method must be overridden in a subclass of the Thread class to define the thread's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#start(): This method is used to start the execution of a thread. When called, it creates a new thread and calls the run() method of that thread to start its execution. The start() method must be called on a Thread object that has been instantiated, but it can only be called once. If start() is called multiple times on the same Thread object, it will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#join(): This method is used to wait for a thread to finish its execution. When called, it blocks the calling thread until the target thread has completed its execution. The join() method can take an optional timeout parameter, which specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the target thread to complete. If the timeout expires before the target thread has completed, the join() method will return, and the calling thread will continue its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#isAlive(): This method is used to check whether a thread is currently running. When called, it returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the target thread is alive or not. A thread is considered alive if it has been started but has not yet completed its execution. The isAlive() method can be used to check the status of a thread and take appropriate action based on its result.\n",

    "#1 Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently, which can lead to faster execution times.\n",
    "#2 Efficient use of resources: Multithreading allows for efficient use of system resources, as multiple threads can share the same memory space and CPU time.\n",
    "#3 Simplified program structure: Multithreading can simplify the structure of a program by allowing it to be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks that can be executed independently.\n",
    "#4 Enhanced responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to continue processing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations or other slow tasks to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex than single-threaded programs, as developers must consider issues such as synchronization and thread safety.\n",
    "#2Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead due to the need to manage multiple threads, which can lead to reduced performance in some cases.\n",
    "#3 Resource contention: Multithreading can result in resource contention, as multiple threads may attempt to access the same shared resources at the same time, leading to race conditions, deadlocks, or other synchronization issues.\n",
    "#4 Debugging and testing: Multithreaded programs can be more difficult to debug and test than single-threaded programs, as issues such as race conditions and deadlocks can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose.\n",
